DonationHelper AKA ReMuse
==============

Created during a civic app hackathon #atthack in Chicago. 
Won first place!

Simple purpose: Rethink what we are putting into the landfills, by making it easy to find places nearby
that are looking for certain things, such as clothing, electronics, furniture, etc. Help an organization in
your city by simply donating instead of throwing away your old things or if you are looking to find an organization
you believe in find things it needs!

We have many ideas on taking this further. Stay tuned!

Note:
This is a work in progress - created in less than a day during the Hackathon
